Usage:
java sender <receiver IP> <receiver port> [loss_param]

java receiver

Working:
The sender's sending port is 1123.
The sender's receiving port is 1124.
The receiver sets its port as specified by the user. with a default value 4358.
The sender works in two different threads, one to send packets for the allowed
Window length from the latest received acknowledgement from the receiver, and the
other to receive acknowledgements from the receiver.

The receiver accepts packets from the sender and updates it's ack parameter to x
if it has received all packets with seq# < x, and sends this ack to sender.
Otherwise it sends the previously sent ack again.

The sender's received thread maintains the Window length, and updates it on every
successful Ack received. It also cancels timers for previously sent packets.
The send thread inserts packets, along with their timestamps into a queue q,
after sending them to the receiver.
A timer of 1000ms checks for packet loss, in the event of which, the entire queue
is cleared and packets with seq# beginning the received ack are sent. The window
is resized to 1 MSS.
